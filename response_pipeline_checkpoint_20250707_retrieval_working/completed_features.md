## 12. Enhanced Features ✅

### Citation System Enhancement (CRITICAL)
- Created `EnhancedCitation` model with full legal metadata
- Implemented multiple citation format support:
  - Legal: [GDPR Article 7(3)]
  - Section: [CCPA § 1798.100(a)]
  - Detailed: [GDPR Article 7, p. 23]
- Enhanced `ContextSegment` with citation fields
- Updated citation extraction with multiple regex patterns
- Modified prompts to emphasize proper citation requirements
- Added citation format testing harness
- Professional legal citation standards now met

### Metadata Strategy
- Implemented conservative approach for current vs. enhanced metadata fields
- Created fallback mechanisms in retriever for missing fields
- Documented requirements in `METADATA_ENHANCEMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Preserved compatibility for future enhanced fields from data ingestion team

### Enhanced Metadata Integration
- Data ingestion team rebuilt index with enhanced metadata
- New index: `regulatory-hybrid-semantic-index` with 402 documents
- Confirmed metadata fields: keywords (pipe-separated), entities, regulation, clause_type
- Updated all environment variables to use new index
- Discovered index contains: GDPR (193 docs) + HIPAA (204 docs) = 402 total

## 13. ~Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation~ REMOVED ❌

### MCP Architecture (Removed - January 2025)
- ~Created comprehensive MCP architecture with tool-based routing~
- ~Built MCP Server, Router, Context Manager, and Tool implementations~
- ~Created test harnesses for each tool~
- ~Dynamic, stateful context management replacing hardcoded patterns~

### Why MCP Was Removed
- **No Performance Benefit**: Response times remained 30-40s with MCP
- **Added Complexity**: Extra routing layer without clear benefits  
- **Citation Issues**: Citations weren't working properly in either path
- **Maintenance Burden**: More code to maintain without value
- **Direct Pipeline Works**: Same functionality available through direct pipeline

### What Remains
- All functionality previously in MCP tools is available through:
  - Query Manager for intent analysis
  - Enhanced Retriever for search
  - Response Generator for synthesis
  - Conversation Manager for context

## 14. Investigation & Analysis ✅

### Missing Documents Investigation
- Investigated 3 numeric fact queries: Denmark age (13), Wiretap prison term, Alabama HMO amounts
- Confirmed these documents are NOT in the Azure AI Search index
- Data ingestion team needs to ensure these documents are indexed

### Test Results Analysis
- Single Question Test (SQ-GA-01): 100% success rate
- Regulation Detection: Fixed (100% success)
- Query Manager performance optimized (under 5 seconds)
- ~Cache Performance~ - Caching removed to focus on quality
- Response Generation: Working with proper citations
- Achieved 100% success rate on test questions (when documents exist)

## 15. Key Technical Decisions ✅

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **LLM-Powered Query Understanding**: Use GPT-4 for query analysis instead of hardcoded patterns
2. **Metadata-Aware Search**: Map queries to pre-indexed metadata fields
3. **Legal Concept Expansion**: Expand legal terms to catch variations
4. **Component Isolation Testing**: Create individual test harnesses with Rich console UI
5. **Dynamic TOP-K Pipeline Strategy**: Progressive narrowing of results through pipeline stages
6. **Progressive retrieval over hard filtering** (better results)
7. **Conservative metadata approach** (backwards compatible)
8. **Task-specific model selection** (GPT-4 for intent/concepts, GPT-3.5 for extraction)
9. **Updated default model to GPT-4** for regulatory compliance accuracy
