        "content": "### Overview of the Topic\n\nThe requirement for opt-in consent for the processing of sensitive personal information is a critical aspect of data protection laws across various jurisdictions. This requirement ensures that individuals have control over their sensitive data, which includes information related to health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, or sexual orientation. Opt-in consent is a proactive approach where the data subject must take an affirmative action to consent to the processing of their sensitive personal data.\n\n### Key Regulatory Requirements\n\nOpt-in consent for sensitive personal data typically requires that consent be explicit, express, or unambiguous. This means the data subject must clearly and affirmatively agree to the processing of their sensitive personal data, often through a written statement or another clear affirmative action.\n\n### Important Definitions or Concepts\n\n- **Sensitive Personal Information**: This refers to categories of personal data which are considered more sensitive, and therefore require higher protection. Examples include health information, racial or ethnic origin, and political opinions.\n- **Opt-in Consent**: This is a form of consent where the data subject must actively provide consent before their sensitive personal data can be processed. It contrasts with opt-out consent, where consent is presumed unless the data subject declines.\n\n### Practical Examples\n\nIn practice, opt-in consent can be implemented through mechanisms such as checkboxes on digital forms that are not pre-ticked, explicit consent forms for health services, or detailed consent agreements for membership in political or religious organizations.\n\n### Jurisdiction-Specific Requirements\n\n**Costa Rica:**\n- In Costa Rica, the processing of sensitive personal data requires express consent. This aligns with the general principle that express consent is needed for the processing of any personal data, with a heightened requirement for sensitive data. This is based on the regulatory framework which specifies that express consent is necessary for such categories of data [Regulation to the Law of Protection of the Person Against the Treatment of Their Personal Data Article 5].\n\n**Estonia:**\n- Estonia requires that the processing of sensitive personal data must be done only with the explicit consent of the data subject. This is explicitly stated in their data protection framework, ensuring that data subjects must clearly and affirmatively agree to the processing of their sensitive personal data [Estonian Personal Data Protection Act Article 9].\n\n**Denmark:**\n- Denmark mandates that sensitive personal data can only be processed with explicit consent from the data subject. This requirement is part of the broader data protection regulations that emphasize the protection of sensitive data by requiring a clear affirmative action from the data subject before any processing can occur [Danish Data Protection Act Article 7].\n\nThese jurisdictions illustrate the global emphasis on protecting sensitive personal data through stringent consent requirements, ensuring that data subjects are fully aware and agreeable to the processing of their sensitive information.",

        "full_content": "1. Which countries or states require consent opt-in consent for processing of sensitive personal information?\n\nSummary\nAcross the documents supplied, opt-in (express / explicit) consent is singled-out as a lawful basis for handling sensitive-category personal data (health, biometrics, beliefs, etc.) in four jurisdictions:\n\nJurisdiction\tCore rule in the text (exact quotation)\tPractical effect\nCosta Rica\t“Quien recopile datos personales deberá, en todos los casos, obtener el consentimiento expreso del titular para el tratamiento de los datos personales” (Art. 5)\nCollecting “datos sensibles … sin el consentimiento de su titular” is listed as an infringement (Art. 59 h)\tProcessing of any personal data—and therefore all sensitive data—requires an affirmative, opt-in consent, save for the narrow statutory exceptions set out in Art. 5.\nGabon\t“Las decisiones… no podrán basarse en datos personales sensibles, salvo que el interesado haya dado su consentimiento explícito para uno o varios fines específicos” (Art. 14 ter)\tA controller may rely on sensitive data only after obtaining the data subject’s explicit, purpose-specific consent (or another public-interest ground named in the same article).\nDenmark (illustrative of all EU/EEA states applying the GDPR)\t“La prohibición de tratar datos personales sensibles… no se aplica cuando se cumplen las condiciones… punto a) del artículo 9(2) del RGPD” —i.e., “consentimiento explícito” (s. 7(1))\nPrivate actors may handle criminal-offence data “si el interesado ha dado consentimiento explícito” (s. 8(3))\tArticle 9(1) GDPR bans processing of special-category data; Article 9(2)(a) lifts the ban only where the person has given explicit consent. Denmark’s Act repeats that rule, so controllers must obtain an opt-in unless another Art. 9(2) exception applies.\nEstonia\tThe Act applies the GDPR in full (§ 2) and repeatedly refers to “datos de las categorías especiales según el artículo 9(1) del RGPD” (§ 10 (2))\tBecause the GDPR is directly applicable, Estonian controllers need explicit consent (Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR) or another Art. 9 ground before processing sensitive data.\n\nDetailed explanation\nLatin-American models (Costa Rica & Gabon)\n\nBoth systems adopt consent-first approaches. Costa Rica’s Regulation No. 37554-JP demands express consent for all personal-data processing, with only narrow carve-outs, making opt-in unavoidable for sensitive data. Gabon’s 2020 Ordinance is narrower—focusing on automated decision-making—but still conditions any use of sensitive data on the data-subject’s explicit consent unless an overriding public-interest ground is met.\n\nEU / EEA models (example: Denmark & Estonia)\n\nThe GDPR (incorporated verbatim in Denmark’s Act and made directly applicable by Estonia’s Act) forbids processing of “special categories of personal data” (Art. 9 (1)) unless one of the Art. 9 (2) derogations applies.\n\nThe first derogation, Art. 9 (2)(a), is the data subject’s “explicit consent to one or more specified purposes.”\n\nNational statutes reiterate or cross-reference that rule; hence controllers in every EU/EEA country must secure an opt-in where no other Art. 9 ground fits.\n\nScope of obligation\n\nIn Costa Rica and Gabon, explicit consent is effectively the sole doorway for routine private-sector use of sensitive data.\n\nIn EU/EEA jurisdictions, explicit consent is one viable doorway; others (e.g., vital-interest, substantial-public-interest grounds) may remove the consent requirement, but where those do not apply, controllers must fall back on opt-in consent.\n\nSource table\nRegulation / Topic\tDocument name\tPage / Art.\tExact text\nCosta Rica – Consent rule\tReglamento a la Ley de Protección de la Persona… (No. 37554-JP)\tCh.

Which countries or states have requirements around obtaining consent from parents or guardians for processing data of minors (under 18 years of age)?\n\nSummary\n\nThe documents you supplied show three jurisdictions that expressly require parent/guardian consent before personal data about minors may be processed:\n\nJurisdiction\tAge-trigger\tMain context\nDenmark\t< 13 yrs\tAny information-society service offered directly to a child\nEstonia\t< 13 yrs\tAny information-society service offered directly to a child\nGeorgia (U.S.-state)\t< 13 yrs (or ≥ 13 if the student does not give consent)\tUse or disclosure of K-12 student data by online “operators”\n\nBelow you will find the exact clauses, with full traceability to the document and file you provided.\n\nDetailed evidence\nJurisdiction\tDocument name\tFile name\tPage / Article / Section\tExact regulatory text\nDenmark\tAct on supplementary provisions to the GDPR (Data Protection Act), Act No. 502 of 23 May 2018\t8 - 2257969a-b379-4eac-8c04-f8eebb276090.pdf\t§ 6 (3)\t“If the child is under 13, the processing is only lawful if and to the extent that consent is given or approved by the holder of parental responsibility for the child.”\nEstonia\tPersonal Data Protection Act (“Isikuandmete kaitse seadus”), in force 15 Jan 2019\t4 - d6e380f3-ea47-4306-a1fa-bbc9bb44a267.pdf\tp. 3 / 19, § 8 (2)\t“If the child is below the age of 13 years, processing of personal data is permitted only in the case and to the extent for which consent has been given by the legal representative of the child.”\nGeorgia (USA)\tOfficial Code of Georgia Annotated, Title 20 § 20-2-666 (‘Student Data Privacy, Accessibility, and Transparency Act’)\t10 - 1f6c8eb0-241e-41b9-8a00-c8679a0ca28e.pdf\t§ 20-2-666 (a)\t“An operator shall not knowingly engage in any of the following activities … without explicit written consent from the student’s parent or guardian, or an eligible student.”\n\nHow to interpret the requirements\nEU Member States (Denmark, Estonia). Article 8 GDPR lets each state set the parental-consent age between 13 and 16. Both Acts you provided pick 13. Processing children’s data below that age requires verified consent or approval from a “holder of parental responsibility”.\n\nGeorgia. Section 20-2-666 forbids operators from using, selling, or disclosing student data unless they have a) consent from a parent/guardian or b) consent from an eligible student (the code defines an “eligible student” as 18 + yrs or post-secondary, and separately recognises student self-consent for those over 13). In practice, for K-12 students under 13, the operator must obtain parental consent.\n\nNo other parental-consent clauses were located in the remaining PDFs you supplied.
