# Priority Improvements Based on Testing Results

*Based on testing 7-8 questions compared to GPT analysis*

## ðŸš¨ **HIGH PRIORITY (Critical for Accuracy)**

### 1. **Fix Federal vs State Law Confusion** 
**Issue**: System presents Georgia state law as federal FERPA without proper distinction
- [ ] Add federal/state law detection to metadata
- [ ] Update response generator to explicitly note when federal law is missing
- [ ] Template: "Federal FERPA text not available; using [state] law as reference"
- **Impact**: Legal accuracy, user trust

### 2. **Add Missing Source Documents**
**Issue**: Missing core GDPR regulation and federal FERPA
- [ ] Index actual GDPR regulation (EU 2016/679) with Article 7(3), Article 8
- [ ] Add federal FERPA statute (20 U.S.C. Â§ 1232g) and regulations (34 CFR Part 99)
- [ ] Verify Article 2 definitional sections are properly chunked for Costa Rica
- **Impact**: Complete comparative analysis capability

### 3. **Improve Chunk Selection for Definitions**
**Issue**: Not finding definitional content (e.g., Costa Rica Article 2(f))
- [ ] Debug why definitional chunks aren't being selected
- [ ] Check if Article 2/definitions sections exist in vector DB
