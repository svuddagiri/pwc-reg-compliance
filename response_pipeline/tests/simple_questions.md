Yes, multiple jurisdictions require parental or guardian consent for processing the personal data of minors under the age of 13 or 18 depending on local law.

### Q12: Is consent valid indefinitely?

No. Consent should be time-bound or reviewed periodically to ensure it remains informed and current.

### Q13: Do data controllers need to maintain records of consent?

Yes. Controllers must be able to demonstrate that valid consent was obtained.
